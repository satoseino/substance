## Arguments

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$spec_path` | Path to the spec file to implement — relative to CWD or absolute. |
| `$focus_prompt` | *(Optional)* Additional instructions for this implementation. Treat every statement in this prompt as if it were written in **bold** — give it higher focal weight than general implementation guidelines when the two conflict or compete for attention. |

**`$spec_path` is required.** If missing, stop and tell the user before doing anything else.
`$focus_prompt` is optional; if absent, proceed with standard implementation behavior.

## Pre-flight checks

Run all three checks before making any change, in order. Stop at the first failure and report it to the user — do not proceed past a failed check.

1. **Spec file exists.** Run via `Bash`:

   ```
   test -e "$spec_path"
   ```

   If it does not exist, stop immediately and tell the user the spec file was not found at `$spec_path`.

2. **Current branch is not `main`.** Run via `Bash`:

   ```
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
   ```

   If the output is `main`, stop immediately and tell the user this skill refuses to run on `main` — check out a feature branch first.

3. **Working tree is clean.** Run via `Bash`:

   ```
   git status --porcelain
   ```

   If this prints any output (staged or unstaged changes), stop immediately and tell the user the branch has uncommitted changes — commit, stash, or discard them first.

## Implement the spec

If — and only if — all three checks pass:

**You are free to make git commits or use state-mutating git commands (`add`, `commit`, `push`, `branch`, `checkout`, `reset`, `merge`, `rebase`, etc.) for the remainder of this session, as you see fit. This is an intentional and explicit greenlight from the global rule that otherwise reserves state-mutating git operations to the user — it applies here specifically because the pre-flight checks above already confirmed a clean, non-`main` branch to work from.**

Read `$spec_path` with `Read` and implement it in full on the current branch, using `Read`/`Grep`/`Bash` (including `git log`/`git blame` for history and authorship context) to explore the codebase as needed and `Write`/`Edit` to make changes. If `$focus_prompt` is present, keep it in mind throughout the implementation as described above. Commit work at logical checkpoints with Conventional Commits style messages that explain why. Use your own judgment on how many commits to make and when to make them — do not ask the user for permission before each individual commit.

When implementation is complete, summarize what changed and report the final working tree state to the user.
